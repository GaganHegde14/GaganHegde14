- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GaganHegde14

- I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Information Technology, currently in my 3rd semester, with a CGPA of 9.4. 
My passion lies in the tech industry, where I enjoy solving problems through data structures and algorithms (DSA) and actively participate in competitive programming. 
I have hands-on experience in building web applications using frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am eager to deepen my knowledge in backend development.

I am also exploring the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on understanding how AI models are built and deployed.
I am always looking for opportunities to expand my technical skills and work on projects that push me to grow as a developer.
